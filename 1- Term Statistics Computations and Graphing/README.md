# CS6200: Homework 1

Term Statistics Computations and Graphing

This first homework assignment starts with term statistics computations and graphing. Raw counts may not be the most informative statistic. One common improvement is to use inverse document frequency, the inverse of the proportion of documents that contain a given term. Besides frequencies and tf-idf values within documents, looking at the distributions of word frequencies in the whole collection is often helpful. In the final section, we collect new documents to experiment with.
