# CS6200: Homework 4


Document Reranking

In this notebook, you will evaluate results ranking on a test collection. First, you'll compute the mean average precision of a baseline BM25 model. Then you'll implement a reranking function that takes the top 1000 results of the baseline model and tries to make more relevant documents rank higher.
